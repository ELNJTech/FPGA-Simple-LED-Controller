# FPGA-Simple-LED-Controller
Basic FPGA-based LED controller project, showcasing basic RTL design and VHDL Implementation.
The two LED's light up at both ends of a row of 8. They simultaneously move towards the opposite side, crossing each other in the middle.

The writeup included in this repository guides the reader through all different stages of RTL design and implementation:
- Problem statement / Pseudocode
- Translation into Simple ASM chart.
- Translation into Datapath circuit.
- Translation into Detailed ASM chart.
- Translation into "One-hot" circuit.
- VHDL implementation in Quartus II.
- Simulation results.
